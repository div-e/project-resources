## Set Up Project Github

### Open Source
Create a project under div-e organizational page. This means that anyone can access your project files. This means that we can provide code reviews and connect you to other helps that bring your project closer to making a real world impact. 

### Private
Create a private repository. Set up your Github educational package first to allow private repository. 
[Github Education Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)
If you would like to share the repository within the organization, create your repository as private under div-e.
